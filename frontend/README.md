# Plan

## Backend

1. Make it possible to add a review to a restaurant
2. Deploy the Docker container and keep the server running

## Frontend

1. Make it possible to find a restaurant from the list (or DB?) Search by title?
2. Make it possible to add a review to a restaurant.
    - Use the updateRestaurant mutation
    - I guess we need to have the input as a form.
    -
3. Show all visited restaurants in a list
4. Show all restaurants on a map. Visited ones in a different color? Maybe a map icon with the logo inside?
