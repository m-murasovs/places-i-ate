# Places I ate

Fun full-stack project to keep track of places I've eaten at.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: ApolloServer
- Database: Mongo + GraphQL
- TypeScript everywhere, strict mode

## Plan

1. Set up auth
2. Configure users for me and Babs ONLY
3. Start frontend
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
5. Restrict CORS on server to only my website
6. Activate server
