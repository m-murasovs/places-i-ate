# Plan

## Frontend

1. (optional) Save reviews in a separate repo. They should be tied to the user and the place. So, userId and placeId.
2. Implement basic visual components
3. Show all places on a map. Visited ones in a different color? Maybe a map icon with the logo inside?
4. Wish list - make some plans!

4. Future:
    - Better scraping
        - scrape eeeeverything - maybe we can set a location for the user and then specify accordingly?
