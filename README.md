# Plan

## Frontend

- (optional) Save reviews in a separate repo. They should be tied to the user and the place. So, userId and placeId.
    - implement a review service
    - update/create reviews instead of places
- Adding new places!
    add a form to create a new place
- Implement basic visual components
    - Links in the menu
    - card for places
- Show all places on a map. Visited ones in a different color? Maybe a map icon with the logo inside?
- Wish list - make some plans!

- Future:
    - Better scraping
        - scrape eeeeverything - maybe we can set a location for the user and then specify accordingly?
        - only add places that aren't already there
